# VUE-MEVN

This project is built using Vue for frontend, Node.js , MongoDb and Express for backend.

Endpoints are created in the Backend API for user registration , authentication and profile.

Front-End uses those endpoints for registering and login process.

Detailed working of front-end and backend can be found in their respective README files.
